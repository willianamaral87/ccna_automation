# BrasilAPI CEP Request – Python Example

The script consumes data from https://brasilapi.com.br, a Brazilian website that exposes a public REST API providing Brazilian public data in JSON format, with no authentication or API key required.

BrasilAPI offers several useful endpoints, including:
- CEP (Brazilian ZIP code) – address information
- Banks – bank lists and details
- DDD – Brazilian telephone area codes
- IBGE data – data from Brazil’s official statistics institute
- Holidays – national holidays

🎯 Project Objective
This project focuses on the CEP endpoint, as it is widely used in Brazil and serves as a great starting point for learning:
- API consumption
- HTTP GET requests
- Response handling using Python

📸 Example
The script sends a GET request to the BrasilAPI CEP endpoint with a given CEP and prints the returned address data.
